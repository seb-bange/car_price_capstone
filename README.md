# 🚗 Car Price Analysis – Google Data Analytics Capstone

This project was completed as part of the Google Data Analytics Certificate Capstone.  
It explores which factors influence the Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of cars.

## 📌 Business Task

**Goal:**  
Help car manufacturers and dealerships understand what drives vehicle prices and identify opportunities to optimize offerings.

**Key questions:**
- What features are most correlated with MSRP?
- Do vehicle type, fuel system, or horsepower affect price?
- How can this insight inform pricing strategy?

## ✅ Key Findings

- Engine HP has the strongest positive correlation with MSRP
- Compact and midsize vehicles dominate the affordable segment
- Vehicle size, engine specs, and drivetrain influence pricing more than brand popularity

---

## 📌 Recommendations

- Focus product line on mid-HP, midsize vehicles
- Offer compact models with high HP for value seekers
- Use fuel type + drivetrain as pricing signals
